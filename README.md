# cdp-neighbor-discovery-computer-network-project
The goal of the developed project is to streamline duties by implementing the current trend of network automation in the system. With the aid of the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), a Python script is exploring all Cisco Network Devices in the initial phase of this project. All connected neighboring devices are displayed by CDP. In the second phase of the project, hostname-IP matching is used and all IPs are written to the file after neighbors have been identified and their IP addresses are known. Additionally, fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) are also written to a distinct file in the second section.

As was already said, CDP is a strong protocol since it enables users to learn more about a device's neighbors.
